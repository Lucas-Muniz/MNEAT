# MNEAT
Implementation of a modified NEAT in Julia. This project was developed for my undergraduation research project at federal University of ABC (UFABC). The implementation of NEAT was based on [Andy's implementation](https://github.com/Andy-P/NEAT.jl).

PS.: This is still an ongoing project, so the repository is not well organized and there is no documentation yet.
